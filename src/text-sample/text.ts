Here are some of the most precious lessons I've learned over the years of traveling.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Appreciation of diversity:</strong></h3><p>Getting used to an entirely different culture can be challenging. While it's also nice to learn about cultures online or from books, nothing comes close to experiencing cultural diversity in person. You learn to appreciate each and every single one of the differences while you become more culturally fluid.</p><p></p><blockquote><p>The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but having new eyes.</p><p><strong>Marcel Proust</strong></p></blockquote><h3></h3><h3><strong>Improvisation:</strong></h3><p>Life doesn't allow us to execute every single plan perfectly. This especially seems to be the case when you travel. You plan it down to every minute with a big checklist. But when it comes to executing it, something always comes up and you're left with your improvising skills. You learn to adapt as you go. Here's how my travel checklist looks now:</p><ul><li><span class="ck-list-bogus-paragraph">Buy the ticket</span></li><li><span class="ck-list-bogus-paragraph">Start your adventure</span></li></ul><p></p><h3><strong>Confidence:</strong></h3><p>Going to a new place can be quite terrifying. While change and uncertainty make us scared, traveling teaches us how ridiculous it is to be afraid of something before it happens. The moment you face your fear and see there is nothing to be afraid of, is the moment you discover bliss.</p>`

Highly recommended!</p><p></p></li><li><h4><strong>Lower Antelope Canyon Review: What To Expect On The Tour:</strong></h4><p>The Lower Antelope Canyon tour takes you through a slot canyon that is below ground.</p><p>This involves a short, sandy walk to get to the slot, a climb down some metal stairs, a single file tour through the slot at a relaxed pace, and then a climb up some stairs to go back to the starting point.</p><p>When we started the tour, they first had us sit and watch a short Navajo tribal dance that was included for free as part of our experience. This was an added bonus and tips are optional. They didn't ask us to pay anything.</p><p>After watching the Navajo dance, we followed our guide and walked about 10 minutes through the desert to get to the slot entrance. It's a short walk, but the heat can be intense. The sooner you get inside the slot the better, because the temps are much cooler!</p><p></p></li><li><h4><strong>What To Do On The Tour (And What NOT To Do):</strong></h4><ol><li><span class="ck-list-bogus-paragraph"><strong>What To Bring:</strong> A driver's license or other ID, such as a passport, for check in. It's highly recommended to wear a hat and sunscreen too. During the tour, you can bring a water bottle, and a camera or phone for taking pictures.</span></li><li><span class="ck-list-bogus-paragraph"><strong>What NOT To Bring:</strong> You can't bring pets, bags, backpacks, strollers, drones, canes, umbrellas, hiking sticks, selfie sticks, or tripods. They don't allow bags of any kind in the canyon. Not even a small camera bag or fanny pack. You'll have to leave these in your car at the parking lot. These are the same rules they have for all of the Navajo Nation slot canyons.</span></li><li><span class="ck-list-bogus-paragraph"><strong>What NOT To Do:</strong> They don't allow smoking, climbing, writing, flash photography, or video recording on the Lower Antelope Canyon tours. Non-flash photos are fine, and you can take as many as you want, although they don't allow you to take pictures on the stairs.</span></li></ol></li></ol>`

When using CDN no download is actually needed. CKEditor is hosted on servers spread across the globe – the scripts are loaded faster because they are served from the nearest locations to the end user. If the same version of CKEditor has already been downloaded (even on a different website), it is loaded from cache. Using CDN reduces the number of HTTP requests handled by your server so it speeds it up as well.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">However, CDN only offers ready-to-use, predefined packages (CKEditor&nbsp;5 builds).
